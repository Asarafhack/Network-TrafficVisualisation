# Network Traffic Visualization

Visualize and analyze network traffic data with this powerful tool. This project helps monitor and understand network activity through intuitive and interactive visualizations.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Visualize network traffic as it happens.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Explore data with interactive charts and graphs.
- **Customizable Views**: Tailor the visualizations to focus on specific traffic patterns.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main application file to run the visualization tool.
- `data/`: Directory for storing network traffic data files.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the web interface.
- `static/`: Static files including CSS and JavaScript for styling and functionality.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python is installed on your system.
- **Required Python Packages**: List of Python packages needed for this project.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

In your terminal or command prompt, execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-traffic-visualization.git
cd network-traffic-visualization
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

Install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Data

Place your network traffic data files in the `data/` directory. Ensure that they are in the required format for the application.

## Configuration

1. **Update Configuration File**: If thereâ€™s a configuration file (e.g., `config.json`), update it with your specific settings such as data sources and visualization preferences.

## Usage

### 1. Run the Application

Start the application by executing:

```bash
python app.py
```

### 2. Access the Dashboard

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to view the network traffic visualizations.

### 3. Explore Data

Interact with the visualizations through the dashboard. Use the available filters and options to analyze different aspects of the network traffic.

## Example Output

- **Dashboard View**: Interactive charts and graphs representing network traffic data.
